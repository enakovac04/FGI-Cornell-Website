      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>
        At First Generation Investors, we believe that financial education is key to unlocking a brighter future. We understand that many high school students may not have access to the resources they need to learn about investing – and that's where we come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our program is designed to be accessible, engaging, and effective. Through our network of college tutors, we provide students with a near-peer approach to learning that makes the material more relatable and easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 8-week course covers a range of investing topics, including compound interest, diversification, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, as well as personal finance topics like budgeting and credit. We emphasize the importance of delayed gratification – a crucial skill for anyone looking to build long-term wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        All students who successfully complete the program are granted a <strong>$100</strong> grant to invest in a select set of ETFs or mutual funds. This serves as an opportunity for students to put their newfound knowledge into practice and begin their investing journey.
